    <h1>Some HTML Code Here</h1>

    <p>Also, as you begin working with the DOM you'll be writing some JavaScript code that selects HTML elements from
        the page and manipulates them.

        When doing this, be sure to include your JavaScript code at the bottom of the HTML document, right before the
        closing body tag.

        The HTML will need to have loaded before the JavaScript is run, otherwise the JavaScript will throw an error
        because the HTML that it is trying to select and manipulate doesn't exist (yet).</p>
