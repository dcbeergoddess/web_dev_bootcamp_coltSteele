# THE DOM | Document Object Model

- The Document Object Model is the interface between your Javascript and HTML + CSS
- Bunch of special JS objects, methods, function that we can use to interact with our HTML/CSS to change thigs and we can add elements, remove elements, change colors, animate things, etc.

- The browser turns every HTML tag into a JavaScript OBJECT that we can MANIPULATE
- Everything is sotred inside of the _document_ object (can use console to see document object, i.e 
- console.dir(document) //prints out entire document object

DOCUMENT: is the root node object that all other objects (body tag, h1 tag, etc) are nested under as they are turned into objects

## SELECT and MANIPULATE

- SELECT an elemnt and then MANIPULATE

- For Example: change the <h1> color using JS

```js
//SELECT an element

```
