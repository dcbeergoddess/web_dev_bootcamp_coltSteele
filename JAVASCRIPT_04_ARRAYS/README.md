# JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS

- First Data Structure (ways of storing data/holding information using javaScript)
- So far we have used variables to hold one piece of information (i.e name, phone number, number)
- Want to be able to hold multiple values(i.e names, etc) and store them all together

**Arrays**

- One of JavaScript's anwser to this problem

**OBJECTIVES**
1. Define and remove/add Data to arrays
2. Utilize built-in array methods
3. Console To-Do List Project

## Intro to Arrays
**Data Structure**
1. Understand arrays conceptually
2. Write code using JS arrays

### Example

- Model a Group of Friends

```js
const friend1 = "Charile";
const friend2 = "Liz";
const friend3 = "David";
const friend4 = "Mattias";

//This is a lot of code and doesn't let us group our friends together
```
- Perfect Use Case for an Array
```js
const friends = ["Charile", "Liz", "David", "Mattias"]
```
