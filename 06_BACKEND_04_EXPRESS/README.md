    - When you call a library, YOU are in control
    - with a framework, the control is inverted: the FRAMEWORK calls you
      - all the control flow is already in the framework, and there's just a bunch of predefined you can fill out with your own code
      - a library on the other hand is a collection of functionality that you can call
